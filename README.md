# The features that github provides
- GitHub is a website where you can upload your work online free of cost, which will be available anywhere and to anyone ( if it is public ).
- GitHub allows others to see your work and suggest improvements ( thatâ€™s the biggest advantage of having 8 billion on this planet ), It allows collaboration of subsets of those 8 billion.
- Github also keeps track of the versions of files, which means you can check the history of improvements in your work.
- One more nice thing about GitHub is, it provides these nice markdown files and renders them so nicely.
